      <description>&lt;p&gt;These working notes are meant as a sort of taxonomy for machine learning, with a natural focus on the sorts of areas in which I am interested from a research perspective. They is meant as a way of organizing my knowledge about machine learning and providing a place to organize the references that I have found useful. These are working notes in the sense that some of the content is a speculative verbal working out of ideas and hypothesis. Hopefully, sections of this type will be reworked as I gain more knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
