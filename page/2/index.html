  <p>I&rsquo;m interested in how problems are solved through the joint processes of framing and optimization within a frame.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m interested in understanding the how these processes operate, both from the standpoint of improving my own problem solving through better awareness and from the standpoint of understand how to build, optimize, and align intelligent systems. As it somewhat implicit here, the role of attention and awareness within problem formulation and framing is very salient to me.</p>
<p>None of us fully understands the nature of the problem that we are beset with from birth. This is a problem in itself. But we dimly recognize that it is something like &ldquo;How we should live, what choices should we make, etc. in order to be happy or otherwise exist in a state that we like?&rdquo;</p>
<p>This problem plays out in the litany of systems which make up each person&rsquo;s world, giving rise to a host of more concrete problems. Systems like</p>
<ul>
<li>The system of my bodymind and its parts</li>
<li>Systems of relationships and social networks</li>
<li>Systems of institutions</li>
<li>(Soon) systems of artificial minds, their parts,  their relationships, their institutions</li>
</ul>
<p>Between systems of successive scales, there is a coarse-graining effect by which complexity at the previous scale becomes &ldquo;washed out&rdquo; in the next scale. But this effect is imperfect. To understand systems at societal scale, we need to understand our fine-scale psychology, and vice versa.</p>
<p>Within this rich problem landscape, here are some problems where I&rsquo;ve recently been interested in finding frames which might reveal new possibilities of resolution:</p>
<ul>
<li>AI interpretability / alignment: Human intelligence is facilitated by attention flows, which serve to coordinate the massive distributed capacity of the mind&rsquo;s parts. These flows occur within a representation space which is interpretable, at least to other parts of the mind. Supposing this pattern of &ldquo;attention as coordination layer&rdquo; is essential to higher intelligence, how can it be useful in improving efforts toward the interpretability / alignment of modern AI architectures broadly viewed as inscrutable?</li>
<li>Metacrisis: The best of all tautologies is Darwin&rsquo;s: To survive, something must be not thoughtful, virtuous, beautiful, good, or anything at all except good at surviving. When the environment is dense with broad spectrum of possibility (a big world in which anything that can be done will be done), this makes it critical that there is good alignment between what it means to be good at surviving and what it means to be good. The lesson of Moloch is that this is often not the case (See Twitter for a microscopic example). But loving, virtuous, forgiving, cooperating things often have an advantage for survival. What technologies (including psychotechnologies) are needed to amplify this advantage? Or more generally, structural changes to society can be enacted to strengthen this alignment?</li>
<li>Personal development: Finding freedom and releasing double-binds by pursuing integrity.</li>

<p>Professionally, I worked as an applied physics in the Air Force for several years on projects involving advanced optical systems, such as high energy lasers, plenoptic cameras, and holographic wavefront sensors. I began a PhD at the University of Washington in 2019, with a focus on . In 2022, I stopped my PhD work to begin working full-time at EigenLabs, a blockchain startup which is working on targeting and blowing up any and all bottlenecks which stand in the way of allowing blockchain technologies to serve as a technological</p>

    Hi, I'm Robert Raynor. Welcome to my homepage! I am a PhD candidate at University of Washington where my research interests can always be found somewhere in the vicinity of "Why does deep learning work?" However, my PhD work is currently on hold while I am helping to build a company to enable open innovation in blockchains... That's right, blockchain! I have an M.S. in Applied Physics, and previously worked as an Air Force scientist on projects involving advanced optical systems, such as high energy lasers, plenoptic cameras, and (digital) holographic wavefront sensors.
